# Implementation of the Modal Analysis platform for the Aeroelastic Computation:

## â€¢	Major Requirements for the Modal Analysis Platform in Aeroelastic Computation:

1.	The structural modes from the linear structural equation are first computed from a FEA solver (i.e. NASTRAN) . 
2.	White noise signal /Signal consisting of sinusoids of different amplitude and frequency  is generated is for the excitation of the   aerodynamic solver in all the computed structural modal direction.
